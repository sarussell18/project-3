                <p align="left">Martin David Ginsburg was born in Brooklyn, to Evelyn (née Bayer) and Morris Ginsburg, a department store executive, and grew up on New York's Long Island. 
                Early on in coupledom, Ruth and Marty agreed that they should pursue dual careers in law and that they would never get in each other’s way — a novel idea in the 1950s, as traditional gender roles were still evolving.
                “He was an extraordinary suitor,” De Hart wrote, “a man ahead of his time. . . . Neither of them thought about social conventions concerning women’s roles.”</p>
                <p align="left">Marty and Ruth married in 1954 not long after graduating. They moved to Oklahoma, where Marty took up an Army ROTC assignment at an artillery base. “After dinner, the newlyweds often spent their evenings reading aloud to each other from Pepys, Tolstoy, Dickens and even Spinoza, although the philosopher was tougher fare,” De Hart wrote.
                It was in Oklahoma that the couple discovered that Marty was the better cook.</p>

                <h2 align="left">“my wife does not give me any advice about cooking, and I do not give her advice about the law. This seems to work quite well on both sides.”</h2>
                <p align="left">A couple of years later, they were off to Boston to attend Harvard Law School. Marty wound up practicing tax law. Ruth took a headier path teaching constitutional law and working on women’s rights issues, racking up impressive legal victories across the country. She and Marty raised two children together.
                After graduating from law school in 1958, Ginsburg joined the firm Weil, Gotshal and Manges. He was subsequently admitted to the bar in New York in 1959 and in the District of Columbia in 1980. 
                Ginsburg taught at New York University Law School as an adjunct faculty member from 1967 to 1979. He was a visiting professor at Stanford Law School (1977–1978), Harvard Law School (1985–1986), the University of Chicago Law School (1989–1990), and NYU (1992–1993). He was a tenured professor at Columbia Law School (Charles Keller Beekman Professor of Law) from 1979 to 1980, and at Georgetown from 1980 until his death in 2010.</p>
                <p align="left">The Ginsburgs were partners not just in marriage, but in the law. It was a tax case that Marty Ginsburg brought to his wife's attention that set her on the path that made her famous: the legal fight for gender equality. When they won the case in the lower courts, the government appealed to the Supreme Court, declaring that if the decision stood, it would cast a cloud of doubt over literally hundreds of federal statutes that treated men and women differently.</p>

                <p align="left">Ruth wrote this about her husband: Andrew is as invested in my career as I am, and that makes a difference in ways big and small. Yes, it means the domestic work doesn’t automatically fall on my shoulders, but it also means having someone to bounce ideas off of. Having a person who will strategize with you, look at your writing and tell you when you are wrong when you don’t want to hear it but need to hear it most. 
                While I’m loathe to give anyone a pat on the head for doing things that women have been doing for decades – taking good care of your children, supporting your spouse – it’s hard not to admire the men who are trailblazers in this regard.
                Men who stay at home to take care of children may be admired in ways that women never are, but they’re also derided for not being traditional breadwinners. Men who care for their children are asked if they’re “babysitting” rather than parenting, and men who put their wives’ careers first are given the side eye and asked if they’re “whipped”.</p>
                <p align="left">So to those men who buck tradition – to men like my husband – I say: thank you. Not just from the women in your life who you are helping, but to the women and men you don’t know – you’re helping them too. Because the more we see men taking on supportive domestic roles, the more the culture will accept it. The more common it will become, and the less thanks like this we’ll have to give.
                And if you’re one of these men and feeling unsure about your decision or feeling attacked by a society that would rather see you bring home the bacon than help your wife cook hers, remember Marty Ginsburg, husband of Ruth.</p>
